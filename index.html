        literally, I didn't expect that... Though <br />we both were in the same
        college <br />we didn't know each other...<br />but suddenly that single
        word<br />
        "Kavitam" made the whole disaster happen. <br />This was the biggest
        twist that I <br />neither expected nor experienced <br />in my life.
